# giathuanapis

This will be a central directory for storing APIs created by me. It is inspired from Google APIs.

The API defined here can be delivered at ease to servers and clients in other **separate Git repositories** using Buf. 

## Example

* `giathuan/examples/fibonacci/fibonacci.proto` is consumed by [fibonacci-jvm-server](https://github.com/duckladydinh/fibonacci-jvm-server).

## Note
Please remember to run `buf lint` frequently.
